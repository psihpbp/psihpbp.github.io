        Why It Matters to Businesses

            <h3>Increased Willingness to Buy</h3>
            Consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of the environmental impacts of their consumption patterns, bringing more business to companies that engage in environmentally-friendly practices. Studies show that stocks associated with companies favoring worker welfare and environmentally-conscious operations outperform their competitors by a significant margin, signaling an evolving economy that places heavy emphasis on environmental performance and social responsibility.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Appeal to New Generations</h3>
            Almost all generations are willing to spend extra for sustainable goods, but especially the youth that will become the future purchasing power. A recent Nielsen global online study found that Millennials continue to be most willing to pay extra for sustainable offerings—almost three-out-of-four respondents in the latest findings, up from approximately half in 2014. Respondents to the survey ages 15 - 20, also known as Generation Z, are willing to pay more for products and services that come from companies who are committed to positive social and environmental impact was also strong—up from 55% in 2014 to 72% in 2015.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Consumers Value Certification</h3>
            Consumers value certification. With increasing abundance of product diversity, consumers rely on certifications to inform their consumption decisions. Fairtrade Foundation’s Barbara Crowther says 76% of the public believe independent third-party certification is the best way to verify a product’s social or environmental claims.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Increase Operation Efficiency</h3>
            A Unilever study concludes that there four major markers for sustainably-operating business success: easier growth (expansion into new markets), lower operating costs, reduced future risk (by reducing volatility of prices of production inputs), and increased brand trust from consumers and investors, leading to more stable operations. While purchasing energy-efficient goods usually comes with a higher up-front cost, the cost is generally recouped over time through savings on repairs, replacements and inefficiencies.
