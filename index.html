            <p>
                The PSI Hyde Park Business Partnership is a student group that aims to promote community sustainability through Hyde
                Park businesses. We offer advice on implementing sustainable business practices. We target four main categories: water
                conservation, energy sourcing, food procurement, and waste management. We also promote businesses that are already
                implementing environmentally conscious practices to raise awareness of their positive contribution to the environment
                and to provide a resource for aspiring sustainable businesses.

                Cumulative negligent business practice can cause lasting detrimental effects on the environment.

                    According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, industrial and commercial energy use (from such sources as electricity use, product transportation, industrial processes, burning fossil fuels to power boilers and produce steam, and using gasoline to power vehicles) accounts for nearly 30 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heating and air conditioning systems pump greenhouse gas emissions from offices into the atmosphere and use up vast amounts of electricity. Many buildings aren’t designed to include energy-efficient systems or technology to reduce the amount of heat and air conditioning they use.

                <li>
                    According to the Green Restaurant Association, the average restaurant wastes between 25,000 and 75,000 pounds of food every year.

                    Conducting a comprehensive waste audit can help identify process inefficiencies and help to significantly reduce operating costs.

                        Being green can be a part of your brand’s identity. According to the Natural Marketing Institute, consumers are 58% more likely to choose brands that value sustainability.

                        Brand loyalty is not only a matter of the best product at the best price. Instead, it’s a matter of demonstrating to consumers that your brand is more than a brand but also an embodiment of the ideals that they hold most important.
