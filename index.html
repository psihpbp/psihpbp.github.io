        <h1 class="">Who We Are</h1>
        <p>
            The PSI Hyde Park Business Partnership (HPBP) is a student group that aims to promote community sustainability through Hyde
            Park businesses. We offer advice on implementing sustainable business practices. We target four main categories: water
            conservation, energy sourcing, food procurement, and waste management. We also promote businesses that are already
            implementing environmentally conscious practices to raise awareness of their positive contribution to the environment
            and to provide a resource for aspiring sustainable businesses.
        </p>

        <h1 class="">Client Sustainability Consulting</h1>
        <p>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            Each business has their own specific resources and goals for sustainability. As such, we craft individualized strategies for implementing sustainable practices after in-person meetings with the client. After implementing sustainability goals that the partnership has agreed upon, we promote the business to the University of Chicago community as one of PSI's certified green parters.

                <h3>Step 1: <div class="processTitle">Initial Meeting</div></h3>
                <p>We schedule an in-person meeting where we measure the current level of environmental sustainability of the business and discuss the details of a sustainability partnership.<br>
                    <br>We provide more details of what becoming a PSI Green Certified Partner entails, including advertising to the University of Chicago community through social media, digital and physical ads.<br>

                <p>Depending on the details of the partnership, we may assist with implementing the sustainability strategy, like forming partnerships with composting companies or suggesting alternate green appliances. <br>
                    <br>We will check in on progress with how the strategy is being implemented and how our consultants can assist further.</p>

        <h1 class="">Why it Matters</h1>
            <h2>For Your Business</h2>

        <div class="">
            <div class="">
                <h5>Climate change harms local agriculture and infrastructure</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Precipitation: Increases in extreme precipitation and evaporation rates will result in severe flooding and drought, posing a risk to agriculture and infrastructure. Shifting precipitation patterns will accelerate the depletion of water supplies for irrigation and expand the distribution and incidence of pests and diseases for crops and livestock. Resulting runoff will also degrade soil resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Temperature: Increasing temperatures will negatively impact crop and livestock production, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment. Crops growing in the Midwest will not be able to adapt to higher temperatures fast enough, and a few extremely hot days may destroy crop yields. Heat stress for livestock will result in large economic losses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prices: This strain on agriculture and livestock will likely increase prices as supply of food decreases.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Sustainability is cheaper</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Utility Bills: Conserving energy and water usage will significantly reduce the cost of your utility bills. Save money by unplugging appliances as well as by turning down the heat and air conditioning at night. Saving money by setting refrigerators to 41°F, which is the maximum temperature approved by the FDA, at night.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Light Bulbs: Halogen incandescent light bulbs, CFLs, and LEDs are more energy-efficient. Environmentally friendly light bulbs are cheaper and last longer when used in large quantities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Printing: Double-sided printing allows you to cut unnecessary costs on paper.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Sustainability is intimately entwined with the welfare of our planet. The United States alone produces 220 million tons of waste per year, much of which ends up in landfills where it produces one of the most potent greenhouse gases - methane. This, combined with other sources of pollution like industrial agriculture and transportation, contributes to the warming climate. Our water and land both face similar challenges: 2 million tons of pollution enter the world’s water sources and 80,000 acres of tropical forest are decimated each day. Our actions are disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems worldwide. As a result, species are going extinct at a rate estimated to be 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.  Making sustainable decisions, such as minimizing waste and energy consumption, and promoting similar lifestyles across our community will preserve the beauty, health, and diversity of our planet and ensure a future for our own species.
