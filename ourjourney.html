                    Hyde Park Business Partnership is a student-run organization but we take our environmental sustainability consulting seriously. Since our founding in 2016, we spent years preparing for giving sustainability consulting and have since refined our consulting process and strategy.

                        <p>
                            We began by researching the issue of pollution and waste in urban spaces, particularly by consumers and small commercial places. We examined the issue specifically in Illinois and Chicago, and were surprised to find how our state and city were lagging behind our neighbors in being environmentally sustainable.

            <h2> Tips/Advice for amateur consulting groups </h2>

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Talk to experts!! Reach out to local green consultants or people in your school’s Office of Sustainability, sustainable restaurants and green activists you may know.  It’s likely they have a lot of expertise in the subject that will be invaluable to you and often they are more than happy to work with other sustainability-minded groups.  They may even let you use their names to lend credibility to your group.  We talked to a green consultant called Mike Stopka and sent members to a sustainable restaurant, Big Delicious Planet, to learn more about good practices.  We got a lot of great consulting advice from Mike and names of local farms and food suppliers from Big Delicious Planet.  Mike also sent us lots of good materials that he used for waste and energy audits etc.  
                </li><li>think about what they need as a business and see if you can offer it to them (i.e. if they want more student in person customers, you can offer them promotion on your campus, etc)
                </li><li>Don’t be afraid to be tenacious.  If they don’t respond, try again, call them and ask if they got you email, show up in person even (politely of course) and say that you really like their business and would love to collaborate with them
                </li><li>start small.  Don’t overwhelm them with huge, expensive changes.  Instead, focus on what they can do that’s manageable, even if it doesn’t have a big impact.  Especially when it comes to small businesses like restaurants and cafes, they often don’t have the budget to make appliance changes or switch food suppliers.  Figure out what they would be interested in doing (i.e. they have a lot of coffee grounds they would like to get rid of sustainably), and start there. The cheaper the better.  You want them to trust you and think its worth working with you before you introduce any more difficult measures like composting.
                </li><li>don’t try to take on too much at once.  Start small with the number of businesses you’re working with, and then build out your network.  Don’t overwhelm yourself by trying to work with every business in your neighborhood or town at once. 
                </li><li>That being said, having a pre-established network can be helpful when talking to businesses.  If you can have on your website a list of other partners and mention established businesses that you work with it can lend credence to your brand.
                </li><li>make sure you are very on top of communication.  For most businesses this far from their main priority, and if you take too long to respond it might drag out communication way longer than you would like.  Don’t be afraid to send follow up emails either, a lot of restaurant owners or managers get many many emails a day and its very possible your first one just got lost in their inbox.
                </li><li>find your angle.  Different businesses have different priorities. Some might be super into sustainability and already have strong opinions on what they should be doing.  Some might just want to attract more student customers 
                </li><li>know your facts and know them cold...
                </li><li>don’t let go of any connection as best you can--if a business reaches out generally to offer catering services etc, email them back and try to use that point of contact as best you can to get them to work with you on sustainability
                </li><li> Stickers!!
                </li><li>be professional!  You don’t have to show up in black tie, but you should try to look smart 
                </li><li>use your student body/ to your advantage.  Take polls, and try to generate data supporting your claims:for example you could take a survey and say 78% of the students at your university are willing to spend up to $5 dollars more on a meal from a restaurant if they believe that restaurant has sustainable practices (as opposed to one that doesn’t)
                </li>
